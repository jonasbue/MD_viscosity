\chapter{Summary}
This project tests the Enskog-Thorne expression for the viscosity
of a fluid mixture consisting of two different hard sphere fluids. 
Using molecular dynamics, such fluid mixtures has been simulated, 
and their shear viscosity has been measured. The results show 
agreement between simulations and Thorne's equation for the 
viscosity of hard sphere fluids.
